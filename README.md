# How it's better.
This modified version of Packet offers simplified packet definitions and minor optimizations.<br>
Additionally there are other minor changes, such as an error message for when you don't initalize on the server.

<br>

# What you need to know.
When using the library, most things are identical to the original, but there is a key difference in Packet definitions:<br>
You don't have to provide names for your packets, and it is instead required to have a shared packets module.

## Packet:
With shared module:
```lua
local Packet = require(path.to.Packet)

return table.freeze({
	MyPacket = Packet("MyPacket", Packet.String),
	MyCoolPacket = Packet("MyCoolPacket", Packet.Number)
})
```
Or put definitions in every script that uses the packets:
```lua
local Packet = require(path.to.Packet)

local myPacket = Packet("MyPacket", Packet.String)
local myCoolPacket = Packet("MyCoolPacket", Packet.Number)
```

## Packet+:
Shared module only:
```lua
local Packet = require(path.to.Packet)

return table.freeze({
	MyPacket = Packet(Packet.String),
	MyCoolPacket = Packet(Packet.Number)
})
```
